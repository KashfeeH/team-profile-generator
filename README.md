## Technologies Used

Open index.js in CLI and inquirer will prompt questions related to the team which will eventually be compiled into a HTML file that can be opened in the browser.

## Contributions
As always, as I am a complete novice in this field, any contributions to improve or correct the work would be highly appreciated. 

## Test
